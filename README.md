### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Senior Software Engineer

I have over 12 years of experience working with software engineering. Currently, I'm working as a software engineer for the fourth-largest bank in Austria, developing back-end software. I've been working in a truly agile environment using SCRUM methodology with CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) to help deliver software to customers in the shortest time with high quality. I do believe in the power of software development focused on the user perspective.
